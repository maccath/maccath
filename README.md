I'm a passionate full-cycle software engineer with ~15 years experience. A highly motivated remote worker who consistently delivers high-impact projects with an emphasis on architectural best practice, security, and automated testing. I love modernising large legacy applications, working on backend infrastructure and mentoring other engineers through public speaking, pair programming and code review. You may know me from the PHP conference circuit.
